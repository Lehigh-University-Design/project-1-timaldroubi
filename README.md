# Project 1: Web Ring: The history of the internet


## Overview
According to wikipedia, a webring is a collection of web pages linked together in a circular
structure, and orgainzed around a specific theme. Most prevalent in the early days of the web,
before the prevalence of platforms, webrings were often developed by passionate amateurs,
eager to carve a space for sharing in the new media landscapes of the internet. Webrings are a
great example of the spirit of self organization, and ad-hoc arrangements of media that occured
before large companies like came along. Though never immune to small scale politics, webrings
are a good example of the initial spirit of the net where people directly experimented with social
arrangments and flattened hierarchies.

## The Project
The goal of this project is simple: explore what’s possible with just a little bit of knowledge of
how to make a website. Using simple tools and a limited knowledge of html, craft a web page
that shares a piece of overall timeline of the history of the internet. The number of stops on this
timeline are too numerous for us to take on entirely, so instead, focus on a piece of history, big or
small, that resonates with you. For example, one student may like to speak about ARPANET, the
precursor of the internet developed by the US Department of Defense, while another student may
like to focus on early net-art or, cyber feminism, or the beginning of blog culture.

## Project Steps
1. Read up on the history of the internet
2. Hone in on some component of this history that speaks to you.
3. Claim your portion of this story in our History of the Internet Figma brainstorm.
4. Craft a web page for our collective webring that explains your piece of the story.
5. Be creative and have fun. Don’t worry about making it look a certain way. Instead, explore and
be playful. Make an animated .gif, or playful page background, experiment with text, use links and
images. Feel free to embed a video. Go for that early 90’s vibe. See what you can do.
6. Publish your page in GitHub pages and share your link with the rest of the class.
7. With the rest of the class, develop a navigation system that everyone will use.
8. As a group, be sure that everyone’s link is accessible in the webring. Make sure the navigation
is set up in such a way that user’s can follow the timeline from beginning to end, or cicularly. Or
even randomly (in case anyone wants to try a little javascript.)



This project will require that you work individually to create your portion of the overall webring.
But also, it’s important that the class come together to be sure you fulfill the goal of creating a
webring where everyone’s page is accessible.
